# Assignment 3: Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains my solutions for the assignment 3 of COMP541 (Deep Learning) course offered in Koc University. Instructions for the assignment can be found in the _comp541-hw3 instructions.pdf_, and my report for this assignment can be found in the _comp541_assignment3_cgozpinar18.pdf_.

## Running Code:

- Running Part1:

  ```bash
  # To run part1 with frequency based model:
  python lm_classifier.py --model FREQUENCY

  # To run part1 with RNN model:
  python lm_classifier.py --model RNN
  ```

- Running Part2:

  ```bash
  # To run part2 with uniform language model model:
  python lm.py --model UNIFORM

  # To run part2 with RNN based language model model:
  python lm.py --model RNN
  ```
